-------- Original Prompt ----------------

[Context]

Advent of Code MX 2025 is a multi-community competition of the
Advent of Code yearly events, but centered around Mexico's tech
communities. It's main goal is to create a healthy competition
and learning environment for anyone participating so its participants
can improve their problem-solving and programming abilities.

Advent of Code MX it's an original idea from Sudo FCiencias.

[What you will build]

You will create a landing page for "Advent of Code MX 2025". In
consequence, all the text in the page (and in the code comments
& documentation) will be in spanish.

This landing page will use the Material Design standards, but will
use the JetBrainsMono font.

The page will firstly explain what Advent of Code MX 2025 is and it's
goals. Then it will have a section where the invited communities logos
& names will be displayed (consider that more logos will be added after).
Each logo will have embedded the community's main link. You will be provided
with the Sudo FCiencias logo. Use this image as a boilerplate to consider
the size and spacing for the other communities. The images will appear in
a rounded, white background.

The end of the page will have a separator and then, in a three (or two)
column way, will feature a link to the repo and the copyright notice.
